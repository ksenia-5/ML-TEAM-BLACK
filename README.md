# ML-TEAM-BLACK

Computer vision challenge: object detection in images
<br>

Challenge goals are:
- Identify the items listed below explicitly in any image.
- A bonus goal would be to determine the number of each of these items in a picture.
- Final super-bonus objective would be identifying other items outside of the list and reporting back.
<br>

The objects to identify are:
- Phone
- Laptop
- Satellite Dish
- USB stick
- Keyboard
- Router
- Keys
- Magnifying Glass
- Server rack
- Mouse

Image data on 10 object classes collected by [Natalia](https://github.com/natalijamahoby). The dataset can be [found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ksenia5/object-detection), along with model-ready featureset X and labels y, and prepared for transfer learning. The script used to pre-process the data is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ksenia5/preprocessing-image-data-for-classification).
